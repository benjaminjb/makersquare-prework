makersquare-prework
===================

A repo for the pre-work for MakerSquare (enrolled C9/Fall 2014)

Our pre-work was largely Ruby-based, including a lot of basic exercises, preserved here for historical interest and/or the help of any MakerSquare students who need a helping hand.

The work here is basic and not refactored post class. The only files I would point people to are banking.rb (the subject of the MakerSquare technical interview) and kiy.rb, which is more for me to come back to when I have time.
